# Predictive-Modeling-using-SPSS
Predictive Modeling Using Large-Scale Data Files

In this project, I engage in building predictive models for customer behavior to assist managerial decisions and recommend actions by following the steps below:

a- Using my analysis in Customer project, choose two customer segments that have little similarity with each other .
b- Choose two dependent variables that represent behavior that companies are important to the company including revenue or profit.
c- For each dependent variable I choosed 5 variables that I believe may be used as predictors of these variables.
a. Include a dummy-coded variable 
d- Develop a predictive model using regression analysis for each dependent variable.
e- Use my calibration sample to build the model and use my validation sample to test it.
f- Communicate my analysis and results in the form of a brief report.
