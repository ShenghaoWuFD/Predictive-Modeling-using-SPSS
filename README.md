# Predictive-Modeling-using-SPSS
Predictive Modeling Using Large-Scale Data Files

In this project, I engaged in building predictive models for customer behavior to assist managerial decisions and recommend actions. I selected sereval variables(Order Number, Recency, Quantity, Pay Method) and find out their qualatative relationships with Profit. Then base on what I found to give business manager some suggestions.

Following are the steps(data from Customer segmentation project):

a- Using my analysis in Customer segmentation project, choose two customer segments that have little similarity with each other.

b- Choose two dependent variables that represent behavior that companies are important to the company including revenue or profit.

c- For each dependent variable I choosed 5 variables that I believe may be used as predictors of these variables and included a dummy-coded variable.

d- Develop a predictive model using regression analysis for each dependent variable.

e- Use my calibration sample to build the model and use my validation sample to test it.

f- Communicate my analysis and results in the form of a brief report.

Conclusions:

(1) For VIP Customers, every dollar increases in revenue, the profit will increase 0.48 dollars; every unit increases in quantity, the profit will increase 1.86 dollars; customers using American Express credit card as a payment method will increase 17.39 dollars profit, compared to other credit cards users. Overall, 93.30% of the profit could be explained by our regression model. 

(2) For Regular Customers, every dollar increases in revenue, the profit will increase 0.49 dollars; every unit increases in purchase order, the profit will increase 1.70 dollars; every month increases in recency, the profit will decrease 0.20 dollars; every unit increases in quantity, the profit will increase 3.44 dollars; customers using American Express credit cards as a payment method will increase 0.58 dollars profit, compared to other credit cards users. Overall, 92.30% of the profit could be explained by our regression model.
